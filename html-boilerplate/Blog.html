        Why im coding.
    </h1>

    <p>
        Growing up, language arts was never my favorite class. I'd 
        sit through <strong>BORING</strong> lectures wondering why I needed
        to learn a language I already knew. But as I completed class after class,
        I came to the realization of what it was all for.
    </p>

    <p>
        Being able to express ones ideas clearly is paramount to success in life,
        <em>and as I grow older,</em> more and more I need to express that beyond just 
        writing. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Learning full stack development will enable me to not only express my ideas
        and motivations in writing, but also in a medium that lets me express my professional skills.
